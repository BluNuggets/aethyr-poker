# Aethyr Poker
A poker game that is heavily inspired by Leisterez Poker from the Roblox Game [Terminal Escape Room](https://www.roblox.com/games/14026026722/Terminal-Escape-Room).

## Rationale
While the game this was inspired on was initially an escape room (that personally felt tedious to do with all the puzzles and it being targeted for solo play compared to group play), one of the rooms (or should I say subpuzzles?) involved a fictional card game that involves a different deck of cards compared to the traditional 52 cards. Laid out was *the entire mechanics of the Poker game (including ones that)* which seemed fun to play on its own. Hence, this is the fully-fledged game on its own from my (BluNuggets) interpretation of the game 
## Mechanics
WIP
## Running the Game
Simply run the code in the terminal using the command `py main.py` (Windows), `python main.py` (Windows, Mac), or`python3 main.py` (Linux). Alternatively, you can run the `main.py` file in your preferred code editor.

## Limitations
The outputs are only outputted through the terminal. Plans to update the game into one with UI Design are unforseeable in the future.
